## Overview

`setup-ros` sets up an environment so that:

- [ROS 2 latest development branch][ros2_latest_development_setup] builds from source,
- non-EOL (End Of Life) distribution of ROS 2 builds from source,
- any ROS, and ROS 2 package depending on non-EOL distribution builds from source

The action will not install ROS, or ROS 2, by default.
To install a ROS binary distribution, pass a value to `required-ros-distributions` (see example below).

:warning: `apt-get update` is flaky on bare metal GitHub actions Linux workers relying on the GitHub APT mirrors.
It is recommended to run `setup-ros` in a Docker container.
See [`jobs.<job_id>.container` documentation](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer).
An alternative approach is to edit APT sources on the bare metal worker (see [#80](https://github.com/ros-tooling/setup-ros/issues/80) for details).

## Supported platforms

This GitHub action aims for strict [REP-3] and [REP-2000] compliance.
`setup-ros` supports all non-EOL ROS distributions, on all Tier-1 platforms.
In particular, this action supports Ubuntu, macOS, and Microsoft Windows.

For macOS, and Microsoft Windows, the OS version specified in the REPs may not be available as a [GitHub Hosted runners][github_hosted_runners].
In this case, this GitHub action CI runs the closest available worker environment.

Users requiring exact REP compliance should run the action on a [self-hosted runner][self_hosted_runner].

This problem does not apply to Linux workers, where Docker can ensure that the action runs the Linux distribution specified by the REPs.

## Tasks performed by the action

`setup-ros` installs the following command-line tools:

- `colcon`
- `rosdep`
- `vcs`

It also performs the following actions:

- On Ubuntu:
  - Setting the locale to `en_US.UTF-8` and, the timezone to UTC
  - GCC and clang default APT packages
  - Registering the Open Robotics APT repository
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using APT
- On macOS:
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Homebrew] and [pip]
- On Microsoft Windows:
  - Installing ROS and ROS 2 system dependencies using [Chocolatey]

The dependencies installed by this package include ROS 2 DDS vendor packages, such as Eclipse Cyclone DDS, eProsima Fast DDS, and RTI Connext DDS.
See [`src/package_manager/*.ts`](./src/package_manager/) for the complete list.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

`setup-ros` is under active development, and compatibility between releases is not yet guaranteed.
Please do not use `ros-tooling/setup-ros@master`.
Instead, pin your workflows to a particular release, e.g.: `ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3`.

### Setting up the worker, and installing the system dependencies

The default behavior is to only install development tools.
No ROS binary distribution is installed in this case.
This setup should be used when ROS is built entirely from source.

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
  - run: vcs --help
```

### Setting up the worker, and installing system dependencies on all OSes

It is possible to iterate on macOS and Windows from the same job (`build`).
Ubuntu requires its own separate workflow as additional configuration is required for Docker.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        os: [macOS-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - name: Setup ROS
        uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
      - run: vcs --help

  build_docker:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ubuntu:focal
    steps:
      - name: Setup ROS
        uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
      - run: vcs --help
```

### Setting up the worker, installing system dependencies and ROS (Linux)

One or more ROS distributions can be installed simultaneously by passing multiple values to `required-ros-distributions`.
This setup is necessary to use the ROS 1/ROS 2 bridge: [ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge).

```yaml
build_docker:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  container:
    image: ubuntu:focal
  steps:
    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
      with:
        required-ros-distributions: noetic galactic
    - run: "source /opt/ros/galactic/setup.bash && ros2 run --help"
    - run: "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash && rosnode --help"
```

**Note: on Ubuntu, `required-ros-distributions` installs the desktop variant for that distribution. This option is not required, and should probably be avoided in most workflows. It is retained for historical reasons and those who specifically do not care about whether their application specifies its dependencies properly.**

### Use pre-release ROS 2 binaries for testing

You can specify if you'd like to use the [pre-release ROS 2 repository][pre_release_testing] in your sources list file by setting the `use-ros2-testing` parameter to `true`.

```yaml
build_docker:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  container:
    image: ubuntu:focal
  steps:
    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
      with:
        use-ros2-testing: true
        required-ros-distributions: galactic
```

### Including RTI Connext

By default this action will not install RTI Connext as it requires acceptance of a non-commerical license.
The license agreement should be reviewed by users on their own before accepting it.
To include RTI Connext, simply set the `install-connext` parameter to `true`.

```yaml
build_docker:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  container:
    image: ubuntu:focal
  steps:
    - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
      with:
        install-connext: true
        use-ros2-testing: true
        required-ros-distributions: galactic
```

### Iterating on all ROS distributions, for all platforms

This workflow illustrates how to spawn one job per ROS release, for every supported platform.

The workflow `test` is iterating on all ROS 2 distributions, on macOS, and Windows.

The workflow `test_docker` is iterating on all ROS and ROS 2 distributions, for all supported Ubuntu distributions, using Docker.
The test matrix associates each distribution with one Docker image.
This is required to ensure that the appropriate Ubuntu container is used.
For example, Melodic requires `bionic`, Galactic requires `focal`, etc.

```yaml
jobs:
  test: # Docker is not supported on macOS and Windows.
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macOS-latest, windows-latest]
        ros_distribution: # Only include ROS 2 distributions, as ROS 1 does not support macOS and Windows.
          - foxy
          - galactic
          - humble
    steps:
      - uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.3
        with:
          required-ros-distributions: ${{ matrix.ros_distribution }}
      - name: build and test
        uses: ros-tooling/action-ros-ci@v0.2
        with:
          package-name: YOUR_PACKAGE_HERE MORE_PACKAGES_HERE
          target-ros2-distro: ${{ matrix.ros_distribution }}

  test_docker: # On Linux, iterates on all ROS 1 and ROS 2 distributions.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        ros_distribution:
          - melodic
          - noetic
          - foxy
          - galactic
          - humble

        # Define the Docker image(s) associated with each ROS distribution.
        # The include syntax allows additional variables to be defined, like
        # docker_image in this case. See documentation:
        # https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-including-configurations-in-a-matrix-build
        #
        # Platforms are defined in REP 3 and REP 2000:

        # https://ros.org/reps/rep-2000.html

            # depending on whether a ROS 1, or ROS 2 is being tested.
            # See 'if: ros_version ==' below for an example.
            ros_version: 1

## Alternative to `setup-ros`

On Linux workers, an alternative to `setup-ros` is to run actions on a Docker container where ROS is pre-installed.
See [Open Robotics DockerHub page][dockerhub_osrf], for instance.

## Developing

For developing and releasing `setup-ros`, see [`DEVELOPING.md`](DEVELOPING.md).
